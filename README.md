# Jim_Williams_Pulse_Generator
====   
This module produces a pulse with a very fast rise time.   
Its main use is for testing oscilloscope rise-time and hence estimating bandwidth.  
For conveience the module is powered from a micro-usb socket.  
Most current oscilloscopes have a USB host socket that can provide the power needed.   
Connection to the oscilloscope will require a BNC-to-BNC adapter.
